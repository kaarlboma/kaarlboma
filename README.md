## 🌟 Projects

### Exoplanet Radius Bayesian Regression Project
Implemented Bayesian Linear Regression from scratch in Rust to predict exoplanet radii based on astronomical properties. With BLR, users can gather more meaningful results by incorporating prior information about the parameters and with rust, efficiently.

### Tea Leaf Disease Classifier Project
This project uses machine learning to identify diseases in tea leaves from uploaded images. The model was trained on 850+ labeled images using XGBoost and achieves 80% average accuracy through 5-fold cross validation.
